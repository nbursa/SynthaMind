## **Running ChromaDB Locally**

To run **ChromaDB** locally for storing and retrieving vector data, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python 3.7+ and pip are installed** on your machine.
2. **Install ChromaDB** (if not already installed) by running:
   ```bash
   pip install chromadb
   ```
3. **Start ChromaDB server**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn chromadb.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```

   This will start the ChromaDB server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. Ensure the server is running before interacting with it.

4. **Verify server status**:
   You can verify if ChromaDB is running by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser or using a tool like `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1
   ```

# EvolvAI

**EvolvAI** is an AI system designed for continuous self-learning through dynamic knowledge exploration. The project aims to simulate human-like learning, where the AI can explore various domains, acquire knowledge, and specialize based on interactions and user guidance.

## Goal

The goal of EvolvAI is to create an AI system that can autonomously explore and learn from different knowledge domains (e.g., medicine, physics), adapt its learning process, and specialize based on accidental discoveries or user input.

## Methodology

- **Self-Learning**: EvolvAI explores knowledge areas by retrieving data from Wikipedia and other sources, categorizing and integrating it to build a knowledge base.
- **Exploration**: The system explores topics based on specialization, with the ability to adjust focus based on user guidance.
- **Knowledge Integration**: As EvolvAI learns new topics, it integrates related knowledge and refines its specialization in chosen fields.
- **Checkpoint System**: The AI prompts users for feedback during learning, allowing for continuous or directed exploration.

## Features

- Auto-learning from a wide range of knowledge domains.
- Specialized learning based on input (e.g., focusing on medicine).
- Interactive user prompts to guide learning.
- Ability to explore related fields dynamically.
